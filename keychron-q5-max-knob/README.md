## Changes Against Default

Basically, I've added some extra media Fn Key options. But the most impactful change is the remapping of the Insert, Delete, Page Up/Down, and Home/End keys.
I use Home/End way more than Page Up/Down so I moved Page Up/Down to the Fn Layer. I've also moved them down one row to make space for both Delete and Insert keys on the normal Win layer.

No changes were applied to the Mac layers.
